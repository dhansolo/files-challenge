  	<h1>Ash Ketchum</h1>
  	<p><img src="./img/AshKetchum1.png"/></p>
  	<p> Ash Ketchum is a Pokemon trainer from Pallet Town. 
        Through his journeys, he has made many friends and 
        defeated many gym leaders, all with the help of his 
        fellow sidekick, Pikachu. But he has also made 
        enemies, including Team Rocket and his rival, Gary.
        Unlike some trainers, Ash is very skilled in training
        his Pokemon and also respects and loves them. Although 
        he has been 10 years old for some time now, his life 
        has been much more eventful than most of our lives.</p>
  	<p> Ash appears in the popular anime/cartoon, 
        <a href="http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Anime">Pokemon.</a> 
        The series follows Ash's journey to become the 
        greatest Pokemon trainer ever. He is followed 
        by his friends, Brock and Misty, and his fellow 
        Pokemon, including Pikachu. Ash and his friends
        encounter many different Pokemon through their 
        journeys, including some very rare ones. Many 
        challenges arise for Ash and him and his friends 
        always find a way to overcome those obstacles all 
        while learning about what it means to be a trainer
        and what it takes to be the best.</p>
